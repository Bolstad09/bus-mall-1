# User stories for Bus-Mall project

## As a Marketing Researcher
* I want an app that gathers information from users by displaying products in groups of three.
* I want a tally of total clicks on an image to determine what is most likely to go into the official catalogue.
* I want a percentage of times an image was clicked out of the amount of times it was shown.
* I want the information gathered to be stored and displayed in an accurate list.
* I want the information gathered to be unbiased and not show results to users until 25 selections have been made.

## As a User
* I want the three images displayed to be unique, with no duplicates.
* I want the images displayed to consistently be random and not redundant.
* I want my experience with the survey to be visually appealing.

## As a Developer
* I want DRY organized code with individual functions for every working action as well as appropriate white-space for maintainability.
* I want to build a constructor function that takes the product images as instances.
* I want an event listener that does not include "bad clicks" in my tally of clicks.
* I want to store user data that does not reset when the same user visits again
